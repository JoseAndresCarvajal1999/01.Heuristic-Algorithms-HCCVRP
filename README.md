# Heuristic-Algorithms
We build some heuristic algorithms for heterogeneous cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem such that we can compared times executions and results, these algorithms are: 

1. Constructive methods: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
2. Local search: Simulated Annealing and Variable Neighborhood Search
4. Random Search: GRASP 
5. Genetic and hybrid algorithms
